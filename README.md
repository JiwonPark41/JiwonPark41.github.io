# Personal Website (GitHub Pages + Jekyll)

Quick-start:
1) Create a repo named `USERNAME.github.io` on GitHub (public).
2) Upload all files in this folder to the repo root.
3) Settings → Pages: source = "Deploy from a branch", branch = `main` (or `master`), folder = `/`.
4) Wait ~1–2 minutes, then open `https://USERNAME.github.io`.

Edit the Markdown files to update content. The theme is `jekyll-theme-minimal`.
