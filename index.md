# Hi, I'm Jiwon Park ðŸ‘‹
I'm a postdoctoral researcher in **Epidemiology** focusing on **statistical genetics**.  
I build robust methods for pleiotropy detection (e.g., **PLACO+**) and apply them to complex diseases like IBD and cardiometabolic traits.

## Research Interests
- Pleiotropy testing (PLACO, PLACO+)
- Caseâ€“control overlap, family-based designs
- Mixture cure models & censored data
- GWAS pipelines, summary-stat methods

## News
- 2025-09: Preparing K99/R00 application.
- 2025-04: Seminar: *A Robust Pleiotropy Testing Method with Applications to IBD Subtypes with Sample Overlap*.
